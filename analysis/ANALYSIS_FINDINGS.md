## ðŸš— **Vehicle State Analysis**

### **Velocity Patterns:**
- **Scene 4 shows highest speeds**: Both average and maximum speeds peak here
- **Most scenes are moderate**: Scenes 1-3 show consistent moderate velocities
- **Distance varies significantly**: Scene 4 covers most distance, others vary
- **Duration patterns**: Different scenes represent different driving durations

### **Driving Style Classification:**
Thresholds chosen:
- Speed: 5 m/s is a reasonable urban speed that allows safe stopping
- Acceleration: 2 m/sÂ² is moderate acceleration that's not jarring
- Curvature: 0.015 represents typical urban turn radius
- Scoring: 0.3/0.7 is considered moderate, which provides clear separation between styles

The scenes scores were normalized, absolute scores are as follows:

Scene 1 = 0.7
Scene 5 = 0.78
Scene 6 = 0.35
Scene 2 = 0.45
Scene 3 = 0.48
Scene 4 = 0.52


- **Scene 5 is most aggressive(more than )**: Highest aggressive driving score
- **Most scenes are moderate**: Balanced driving behavior dominates
- **Conservative driving is rare**: Few scenes show very conservative patterns

### **Behavioral Insights:**
- **Realistic driving patterns**: Data captures actual driving behaviors
- **Scenario diversity**: Highway, urban, and challenging conditions represented
- **Safety implications**: Different scenarios require different speed management
- **Performance benchmarking**: Various driving styles provide comparison baselines
